        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>People with vaginas need a centralized, holistic, and secure way to track their reproductive health and easily access a wide range of health resources because every person’s health is unique and private while simultaneously being confusing or overwhelming.
          We will know this to be true when we see users being more proactive with their health and utilizing the resources available to them. This will be determined based on user feedback in tandem with the apps user activity.

        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>Ovee empowers vagina-havers with curated resources and a personalized health hub that supports them through the different stages of their lives so they can confidently navigate their sexual & reproductive health.</p>

        <h3>The Process</h3>
        <p>In order to create an app focused on sexual and reproductive health that is tailored to my target demographic, I relied solely on user research, UX principles, and my design skills. My decisions were validated through research, testing and feedback. Each element of the app was designed with intention</p>

            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>To better understand users and their viewpoints of health apps, it was necessary to identify general barriers users experience related  to sexual and reproductive health as well as the pain points of any health apps they are currently using. Pinpointing any potential areas of friction before beginning to development process will allow me to stay on track to creating a successful and useful app.
              User research analysis and affinity mapping helped to determine my users needs, goals, area of friction and other key pieces of information to create Ovee.

            <h3>User Personas</h3>
            <p>In order to gain empathy for my target audience and their individual characteristics or life situations, it was important to establish user personas. The personas allowed me to remain focused on the most valuable features of my app.</p>

                <h3>User Flows</h3>
                <p>Before mocking up the design of Ovee, I went through and created user flows to determine which route the users would take to complete their tasks and meet their goals. Focusing on three main features—searching fro resources, chatting with a health professional, and tracking health information—will help to ensure that Ovee will meet the needs of the users.</p>

                  <h3>Sitemap</h3>
                  <p>Based on the user flows and a method called ‘card sorting’ where test participants used pre-determined categories to sort which features belonged together, I was able to map out the app.</p>

                <h3>Wireframes & Prototyping</h3>
                <p>Once the sitemap was finalized, the initial wireframes were created. They started out as hand drawn low fidelity prototypes that were then translated into mid-fidelity prototypes. After several rounds of usability testing and revisions, the final prototype began to take shape.</p>

                <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
                <p>When creating the final prototype it was important to take into consideration visual design principles, accessibility, along with the feedback received from users throughout testing. The goal was to keep the. app as simple and minimalistic as possible while still maintaining a fun but professional tone. It's important that Ovee's look and feel is approachable and trustworthy in order to create a safe space for users to explore and learn about their sexual and reproductive health.</p>
