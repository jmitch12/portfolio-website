        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>INSPOREATION empowers young girls to understand a products lifecycle and impact, helping them think critically about contemporary environmental problems. It is an opportunity to explore the possible future uses of biomaterials, become comfortable with hands-on learning and the possibility of failure, develop mindful design practices, and consider the implications of designing something that comes directly from nature and can be returned back to nature in a more sustainable process. These bio-accessories make sustainability and bioscience fashionable and allow the wearer to make a statement that they care about the environment.
        </p>
        <p>The benefit of INSPOREATION is multi-faceted—inspiring young girls to engage in STEM topics, encouraging mindful design practices, supporting identity development for girls, and creating awareness of sustainability and the environment.</p>

                <h3>The Bioaccessory</h3>
                <p>The accessory form is created using compostable algae plastic that is produced through a sustainable process. Following the accessories lifecycle, there are several options for the bio-designer to consider as their accessory grows.</p>
                <p>If the organism that is growing has become too large for the form it can be transplanted into a larger container or replanted outside. The organism is able to continue its lifecycle with or without the bio-designer. They then have the option to reuse the form with a new organism, pass the form along to a friend, or they can bury it in the ground to biodegrade.</p>

                <h3>The Kit</h3>
                <p>The INSPOREATION kit provides the bio-designer with the necessary tools to create her bio-accessory. It takes advantage of sustainable and biodegradable materials such as mycelium and post-consumer paper.</p>
                <p>The playful and creative nature of making provides an avenue for people to engage in scientific problems and develop a personal connection to what they are learning. By offering this hands on and creative avenue to explore bioscience, the goal is to teach children and teens to not only engage in ecology, environmental science, and biology, but to reconnect with the things that they wear.</p>

                    <h3>The App</h3>
                    <p>The INSPOREATION app provides the bio-designer with a way to connect to a community with similar interests and to track the progress of their own bio-accessory.</p>

              <h3>Research</h3>
              <p>Historically science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) have been dominated by men, continually substantiating the issue that across many cultures these fields are associated with males. Following this ideology, males significantly outnumber females within the current STEM educational system and workforce. Without women in the most influential, prolific, and fast-growing fields we are innovating in environments that are dominated by perspectives and experiences that reflect only one half of the world’s population. The problem is, how do we encourage women to remain engaged in STEM? It starts at a young age by making science accessible to young girls, and promoting creative exploration and tactile experimentation that make learning more personal.</p>
              <p>Informal Science Education (ISE), “learning in (STEM) that takes place across a multitude of designed settings and experiences outside of the formal classroom,” can be a way to initiate a transformation within STEM. People learn in a variety of ways that are not solely dependent on their formal education. ISE allows for cross-disciplinary experiences, exploration into new forms, and an opportunity to be creative. Introducing young girls to STEM outside of the rigid standards and prolific bias of the educational system provides an opportunity to create without limits</p>
              <p>Todays fast fashion has taken a toll on the environment. INSPOREATION empowers young girls to understand a products lifecycle and impact, helping them think critically about contemporary environmental problems. These bio-accessories make sustainability fashionable and allow the wearer to make a statement that they care about the environment.</p>

              <h3>User Testing</h3>
              <p>The forms were tested amongst a group of 13-year-old girls. They were asked to choose an accessory and organism that appealed to them and wear it whenever they wanted and for however long felt right to them. The interest in the process was overwhelming and finding willing participants for the user test was an easy task. It seemed that the concept and appearance of the accessory were appealing to the young girls. Their response to the interaction and testing of the product was equally positive. One of the girls suggested that she appreciated the uniqueness of the product and the response she received as a result. While wearing the accessory, they received compliments and in some cases there were instances of observers curious about where they might be able to purchase their own. The girls were willing to wear the accessory to school and to share it with their friends through social media.</p>

                </picture>
                <p>Unfortunately, as expected, there were issues with the durability of the accessory. Several of the girls suggested that they were either worried about their organism falling out or they lost their organism. Overall the user test was sufficient in gauging interest. The results helped in determining the appropriate accessory form and highlighting the remaining weak points of the project.</p>

                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p>After testing multiple materials—plastic, mycelium, wood, bioplastics—an algae based 3D print filament developed by ALGIX was the ideal solution. The ALGIX filament is comprised of biodegradable plastic in combination with algae, the smallest and simplest form of aquatic plants. Algae have remarkable potential as “one of nature’s most prevalent and productive plants and an important bioremediator of waste products in nature.” ALGIX harnesses the potential of algae to create a sustainable product lifecycle. To create the material, ALGIX grows fresh fish, in support of sustainable fish farming, as a part of a synergistic system with algae cultivation as a way to absorb excess nutrients from waste water and yield clean water and algae biomass. The biomass is then collected and converted into bioplastics. The process works to provide fresh food, mitigate pollution, and produce sustainable materials as a replacement for traditional petroleum-based plastics. The sustainable process of the ALGIX 3D print filament fit seamlessly into the INSPOREATION lifecycle.</p>
